# nuxeo-api-testing
Scripts for validating the output of Nuxeo API calls for retrieving metadata.

We have had issues with the Nuxeo API returning faulty results. Depending on the query, this could be an inconsistent number of records each time the query is run; or the same number of records but with duplicate results. Since Nuxeo support did not usefully respond to our ticket for several years, we wrote a script to query the database directly as a workaround. Nuxeo tech support has now finally responded to our ticket and suggests that adding an `ORDER BY` clause on a unique field such as uuid should fix the problem. The scripts in this repo compare the results of a Nuxeo API query vs the results of a direct database query using our in-house workaround script. We would love to be able to rely on the Nuxeo API rather than maintaining our workaround script if we can verify good results.
